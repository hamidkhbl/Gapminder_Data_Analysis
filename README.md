# Gapminder data analysis
I started working on world population data after reading the book [Factfullness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness) and getting familiar with [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/).

In this project I have analyzed five data set(Child mortality, Children per woman, income per person, population and life expectancy) and tred answer three questions:
-  Which countries are among the top 10 countries in each dataset each year?
-  How child per woman and child mortality impact population and income per person? 
- How child per woman correlates with life expectancy?

#### Data Visualization
I have implemented a simple race bar chart to answer the first question.

Answer to the second and third questions are visualized by a [Plotly animated scatter plots](https://plot.ly/python/animations/).

#### Packages
To see the visualizations you may need install to these packages:
`conda install -c plotly plotly`
`conda install -c plotly plotly_express`

##### Note:
I have used animated data visualization which makes the notebook file larg in size. To make the jupyter notebook file smaller, I have commented some visualization codes. To see all the visualizations clone the repository and uncomment the code and run it.
