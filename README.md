# Gapminder data analysis
I started working on world population data after reading the book [Factfullness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness) and getting familiar with [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/).

In this project, I have analyzed five data set(Child mortality, Children per woman, income per person, population and life expectancy) and tried to answer three questions:
-  Which countries are among the top 10 countries in each dataset each year?
-  How child per woman and child mortality impact population and income per person?
- How child per woman correlates with life expectancy?

##### Note:
I have used animated data visualization, which makes the notebook file large in size. To make the Jupyter notebook file smaller, I have commented some visualization codes. To see all the visualizations clone the repository and uncomment the code and run it.
